title: "The move to open source"
---

As a bit of background I've been working at World First for four years. In February I decided to hand my notice in with no new job to move to. My final day at World First is May 20<sup>th</sup>. I haven't been very clear on what I'm planning to do next&mdash;primarily because I didn't know&mdash;so in this post I'm going to outline what I plan to do after World First. This plan is vague but I'm a big fan of not having clearly defined plans and being able to change things as I go. I prefer goals and problems, but that's a different post for a different day.

## The problem with commercial work

The first thing I know is that I don't want to get another job. Jobs are great and offer a lot of things, but I've found myself frustrated at the corporate world, at reinventing and competing instead of being able to collaborate with competitors to improve the industry in its entirety. I wasn't really able to so clearly state that before, so initially my plan was to create a product of some kind and focus on building it. I spent a lot of time writing down ideas, both commercial and non-commercial. What I found was a strong disinterest in any commercial product I would be working on. I don't feel like it's the most effective way for me to reach an audience and make any sort of difference.

I'm sure I could find myself a niche commercially that's viable and fills a gap for people. I could build yet another social analytics platform, or yet another commercial dropbox for X niche. I could find an underserved vertical market and make their process more efficient. The issue is that whilst I can do these things, they don't excite me. I'm not going to jump out of bed to build a POS system for fishmongers. I'd definitely kill myself doing anything around social marketing.

I also can't see myself paying for these things. I don't pay for much software myself. I don't have a smartphone and never bought an app for it when I did have one, and my desktop is running Linux. I have a VPS, and an IntelliJ license. I think that's all I pay for right now. Maybe I would pay for Photoshop too if I find myself doing more design work again, but that's probably because it's the devil I know.

## Where my interests lie

Three primary topics always catch my interest: filesystems, databases, and SDLC. The first two are very connected in what I find so interesting, it's the whole strong guarantees and robustness of these things that I love. For the SDLC I'm very interested in how to keep myself and other developers moving fast. I've seen the impact of large growing complex systems first hand and watched as developers struggled to work at the same pace over time. I want to try and improve the long-term pace of things, to find out how a project should be started and maintained to keep a sensible pace over many years.

In these niches there are plenty of closed source projects, but none that I care about. So that leaves me wanting to focus on open source projects.

## The plan

So putting that together it's clear that I want to be working on open source projects.

Awesome! I get to spend all of my time writing open source software. There is one small snag with open source projects: you generally don't get paid. To be honest given how much I enjoy doing this I am doing it purely for the love anyway (aww). The problem is I do like to eat and have a bed. So how do I intend to support myself? Well the answer lies in the fact that I still find joy in writing software, even if it's less joyous to do it for profit. I'll still be free to pick up a consulting gig or a contract. I'll be building up contacts through my open source contributions and most likely various other antics as well (I do love antics). So that's the gist of it: spend as much time as I can working on the betterment of computing and society as a whole and try to use my contributions as an advertisement for getting contracts and doing consulting work when I need to buy some bread.

## My goals

I really hope that I can make a small contribution to the betterment of computing as a whole. I want to improve some existing projects that I love (postgres and phabricator are my first two). I also want to build a handful of new tools that I think are missing from the world right now.

I'll document my transition for anyone interested in pursuing a similar path. There are a lot of altruistic programmers out there who will have similar sentiments so if my own&mdash;most likely rocky&mdash;journey is documented at least the pitfalls will be clear for the next altruistic programmer who can then write their own set of essays.
