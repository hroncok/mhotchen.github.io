title: "Stop reading the comments"
---

I've been a big fan of using [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming), and [Lobsters](http://lobste.rs/) for getting a digest of the latest news, breakthroughs, and techniques in programming for most of my career. These places have been a great source of learning about new concepts and technologies that I would have otherwise missed. There has been a problem though and I've only recently noticed it.

When I find an article that looks interesting my workflow is thus: a) read the title b) read the comments c) feel like I've learnt something. I've been doing this for years. I do read articles as well, but for the majority of potentially interesting articles out there this is what I've done. My experience in the comment area on these sites indicates that this is typical. Recently I've discovered that my mind has been playing tricks on me. When reading comments my brain tells me it learnt something, and that this was worth the time invested. I get instant gratification. In comparison when reading the actual article or a book I sometimes get this negative feeling when the subject is difficult and I have to reread, test, and study. "Why go through all that work?" my brain tells me, "just head to the comments and you'll get more value".

This negative feeling is important though. When I'm studying any subject one of the most important parts is where I make myself uncomfortable by challenging myself and my understanding. That moment where I have to pause and bring something up that is fuzzy but then gets stronger is when I begin to actually understand a subject. I (almost) never get that feeling from comments. Instead I get a quick gratification loop telling me I'm learning. This is also true of summarized text.

So now I've stopped reading the comments first. I read the article. If I don't finish it I don't read the comments. If I finish it then I read the comments for rebuttals and different perspectives but only to deepen my understanding.

Although my brain is telling me this isn't efficient the reality is that I've already got a higher quality understanding on a few topics just from reading some articles on them.
