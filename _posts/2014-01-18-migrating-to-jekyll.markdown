Out with the evil Mr. Hyde
--------------------------

After 2 years on wordpress I can safely say that it's a bit of a monster, and don't like it. It's slow, I've been
hacked, it has the wrong features (decent user management, but no code highlighting by default), and customizing
templates remains an absolute nightmare.

Enter Jekyll
------------

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) generates static files from markdown which I can serve using any old webserver (for now
that would be github pages).

No more fear of getting hacked, no more 30 calls to a database, version control for my posts, a super clean and
simple templating system, and vim as my editor. Beautiful :)

### Migrating from Wordpress
Using [Jekyll Import](http://import.jekyllrb.com/) was quite easy. It exported all of my articles, comments, etc. and
they all work (though they require some basic reformatting, which is to be expected).
